# Mini Orchestrator — Roadmap

Living TODO. `[x]` = done and merged to `master` (or later). `[ ]` = pending.
This file is the quick-reference snapshot across phases. The deep
architectural details live in [plan.md](plan.md).

**Last updated:** 2026-04-16
**Current phase:** 4.2 — Design docs + cleanup

---

## Phase 1 — Project setup + core scaffolding  ✅

- [x] GitHub repo (`MorAghion/mini-orchestrator`) + three-tier branch model (`feature/* → master → main`)
- [x] Project structure (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`, `tests/`)
- [x] `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Python deps, FastAPI skeleton, SQLite init
- [x] Initial commit pushed (`6271ab2`)

## Phase 2 — Stage 1 doc generation pipeline  ✅

- [x] Pydantic domain models (Project, Wave, DocTask, Artifact, ReviewReport)
- [x] SQLite schema + forward-only migrations
- [x] `BaseAgent` — async Claude Code CLI loop (subprocess + JSON envelope + `--json-schema`)
- [x] System prompts for all 10 roles (Lead, 8 doc agents, Reviewer)
- [x] `LeadAgent.plan_stage1()` — forced tool call emits `WavePlan`
- [x] `DocWorkerAgent` — one class, configured per role
- [x] `ReviewerAgent` — structured output via `--json-schema`
- [x] Wave engine: sequential waves + `asyncio.gather` within + `Semaphore(MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS)`
- [x] One rework cycle after review, flagged roles only
- [x] Artifact store (disk = source of truth, SQLite = metadata index)
- [x] CLI runner: `python -m backend.run_stage1 "idea"`
- [x] Full end-to-end run verified against a real idea

## Phase 3 — REST API + SSE  ✅

- [x] In-memory `EventBus` (asyncio pub/sub, per-project fan-out)
- [x] Wave engine emits events at every transition (project/wave/task/artifact/review)
- [x] `POST /api/projects` — kicks off Stage 1 in the background
- [x] `GET /api/projects` — list recent runs
- [x] `GET /api/projects/{id}` — project + waves + tasks
- [x] `GET /api/projects/{id}/review` — review report JSON
- [x] `GET /api/projects/{id}/artifacts` — metadata list
- [x] `GET /api/projects/{id}/artifacts/{filename}` — markdown body from disk
- [x] `GET /api/projects/{id}/events` — SSE live stream
- [x] `main → 103d43d` promoted (milestone 1)

## Phase 4 — React frontend  ✅ (initial) + 🟡 (UX polish branch)

### 4.0 Scaffold and initial UI  ✅ (merged)
- [x] Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold
- [x] Typed API client + `useEventStream` + `useProject` hooks
- [x] `ProjectForm` (single textarea — placeholder shape)
- [x] `Board` — waves + cards with role-colored left border
- [x] `ActivityPanel` — one-way SSE feed
- [x] `ReviewPanel` — verdict + issue list
- [x] `ArtifactViewer` — modal with markdown (initially as preformatted text)
- [x] Vite dev proxy `/api/* → :8000`

### 4.1 Conversational Lead + right-panel redesign  🟡 in progress

**Backend (4.1a):**
- [x] New project status `shaping` (draft exists before Stage 1 launches)
- [x] `lead_messages` table (persistent chat per project)
- [x] `notes_queue` table (user-dropped notes awaiting absorption into review)
- [x] `LeadAgent.chat()` with three personas:
    - [x] Shaper — asks clarifying questions pre-run, maintains draft brief
    - [x] Narrator — reports progress during run, queues user notes
    - [x] Refiner — accepts revision requests post-run, triggers targeted rework
- [x] `POST /api/projects/{id}/chat` — non-streaming for now (returns JSON once Lead finishes); streaming deferred
- [x] `POST /api/projects/{id}/launch` — transition `shaping → planning`
- [x] `POST /api/projects/{id}/notes` + `DELETE /.../notes/{note_id}` + `GET /.../notes`
- [x] Accumulate `total_cost_usd` from CLI envelope into `projects.cost_cents`

**Frontend (4.1b):**
- [x] Home screen: "+ Start new project" creates a shaping project and jumps into chat
- [x] `Chat` component — message list + composer + animated typing indicator + markdown rendering for Lead bubbles
- [x] `PendingNotes` strip — chips with click-to-drop, hidden when empty
- [x] Right panel re-layout: Chat (top) · PendingNotes · Review · Activity (collapsed)
- [x] "Launch Stage 1 →" CTA surfaces above the composer when the Lead has set the brief
- [x] Cost indicator in header ("$0.09 equiv · free under Max")

**Post-run + polish (4.1c):**
- [x] `POST /api/projects/{id}/revise` endpoint: default-role-set fallback, explicit role list, validation guards
- [x] `run_revision()` in wave_engine — re-runs affected agents with the user instruction, re-runs the Reviewer, emits SSE
- [x] Wave schema: `is_revision` column + migration; revision waves distinct from reviewer-rework waves
- [x] Frontend Chat surfaces "Lead suggests a revision: … [Apply / Skip]" CTA when refiner emits REVISION_REQUEST
- [x] Frontend Board labels revision rounds ("Revision round" + ✎ User revision badge) — distinct from "Rework round" + ↻ Fix pass
- [x] Tests: 8 backend route tests for /revise, 5 frontend Chat tests for the revision UI
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout for chat-first home screen

### 4.2 Cleanup + promote  ✅ (partial — commits on `feature/frontend-ux`)
- [x] Light theme fix (matches `docs/design/board_split.html` exactly)
- [x] Plain-English labels throughout (`Stage 1 → "Documents generation"`)
- [x] Card status chips + collapsible completed waves + clickable full-row + ESC-closes-modal
- [x] Rework wave labeled (`is_rework` column + migration + UI badge)
- [x] Markdown rendering via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`
- [x] Stage tabs at top of board (`Documents` active, `Code` disabled)
- [x] Side-panel backgrounds match sprint-row cream
- [x] Artifact cleanup — disk = source of truth, drop `artifacts.content` column
- [x] Pre-commit hook + CLAUDE.md project contract
- [ ] Merge `feature/frontend-ux` → `master`
- [ ] Promote `master` → `main` once Phase 4.1 stabilizes (milestone 2)

## Phase 5 — Bridge + Stage 2 foundation

- [ ] Config Generator agent (generates `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/settings.json` + per-role agent instructions for **generated** projects)
- [ ] Stage 2 data model:
    - [ ] `stage2_tasks` SQLite table (metadata index only)
    - [ ] `task_deps` SQLite table (dependency graph)
    - [ ] `handoffs` SQLite table (metadata index only)
    - [ ] Disk layout: `tasks/sprint-N/task-NNN.json` + `tasks/unassigned/handoff-NNN.json`
- [ ] PRD → task DAG breakdown (Lead's new tool: reads PRD, emits sprint plan)
- [ ] Sequential task ID generator (`task-001`, `task-002` — Lead is sole creator)
- [ ] CLI manager: spawn/manage long-running Claude Code CLI sessions as coding agents
- [ ] Branch-per-agent git workflow (worktrees or branch switching)
- [ ] Heartbeat + crash-recovery plumbing (read `notes.next` to resume)

## Phase 6 — Stage 2 TDD execution

- [ ] Test Agent — writes tests first from acceptance criteria
- [ ] Code Agent — implements against tests via Claude Code CLI
- [ ] Test verification loop (green = done, red = retry, persistent red = handoff)
- [ ] Handoff system (agent creates handoff → Lead reassigns)
- [ ] Branch merging policy (Lead: feature → master on green; master → main at sprint boundary)
- [ ] Human action cards (drag-and-drop to resolve)
- [ ] Mid-run chat interjection (skip task, change approach, reassign)
- [ ] Stage 2 board view (hybrid kanban: sprint rows + Running/Blocked/Done columns inside active sprint)

## Phase 7 — Polish + ship

- [ ] README with architecture diagram, screenshots, demo GIF
- [ ] Error handling hardening (CLI retry, context budget, graceful degradation)
- [ ] **Humanize the Lead's chat voice** — currently reads too robotic
      (bullet-heavy replies, overly structured clarifying questions,
      "proposed brief" formal headers). Rewrite the three chat prompts
      (shaper/narrator/refiner) to feel like a thinking partner:
      looser prose, variable reply length, sparing use of bullets,
      warmer tone. Consider also whether the shaper's opener should be
      an open question instead of a two-question interview.
- [ ] **Auto-expand any wave with a card in progress.** Today the wave's
      `expanded` state is set once on first render based on whether any
      task is running; if the user collapses an active wave, it stays
      collapsed even when later tasks land. Make a wave with at least one
      `running` task always render expanded, regardless of prior toggle —
      user can still collapse `done` waves freely.
- [ ] **Collapse / group old revision waves.** After 5+ revisions the
      board grows a long stack of near-identical "User revision wave"
      cards. Group them under a collapsible "Past revisions (N)" section
      under the board, keeping only the most recent 1-2 expanded. Each
      summarized to its instruction so users can find a specific past
      change quickly.
- [ ] **Reviewer summary — find a better home.** The wave engine used to post a
      full reviewer summary (verdict + all issues) as a Lead chat message. This
      was reverted because it bloated the chat history and made subsequent Lead
      CLI calls very slow (whole history re-sent each turn). The reviewer verdict
      + issues need a dedicated surface instead. Combine with the modal below.
- [ ] **Review report modal.** Currently the Reviewer's issues are expandable
      inline in the Timeline (click `▸` on the "Reviewer agent: approved — N issues" row).
      Replace or augment with a dedicated modal: larger reading surface,
      filterable by severity, each issue shows affected doc with a direct
      "Open artifact" link. Trigger: click the reviewer row in the Timeline
      OR a "View review" button in the board header when `stage1_done`.
      The modal should also show a compact one-line summary (verdict + count)
      in the board header so the user is aware without having to open it.
- [ ] Demo recording
- [ ] Blog post (ai-from-scratch chapter 19)
- [ ] GitHub polish (description, topics, social preview image)

---

## Cross-cutting / whenever

- [ ] **Terminal chat wrapper** (`python -m backend.chat <project-id>`) — hybrid power-user surface.
      User chats with the Lead in the terminal (readline loop, markdown stripped to plain text);
      the web dashboard stays open in a browser and shows live agent progress via SSE as normal.
      Neither surface owns state — both read/write the same DB and the same wave engine fires.
      Extra affordances the terminal gets over the browser: pipe in files, script multi-turn
      sessions, tail uvicorn logs in a split pane while chatting, call `run_stage1` /
      `run_revision` directly without going through the Lead.
      Implementation: ~50-line wrapper around `LeadAgent.chat()` + a `readline` loop.
- [ ] API-key-only fallback path (for users without a Claude subscription; pay-as-you-go)
- [x] **Testing infrastructure** — pytest/pytest-asyncio/httpx backend, vitest/RTL/jsdom frontend, ruff + py_compile in pre-commit, GitHub Actions CI (backend + frontend + precommit hygiene). 66 tests passing (47 backend + 19 frontend).
- [x] Wave engine coverage (partial) — `tests/backend/test_wave_engine.py` covers notes absorption across review/rework/revision paths, wave-flag persistence (is_rework / is_revision), the empty-notes baseline. 6 tests. **Still TODO:** semaphore concurrency limits, parallel/sequential ordering within a wave, failure-cascade path.
- [ ] Replace `datetime.utcnow()` everywhere with `datetime.now(UTC)` (deprecation warnings suppressed in pytest config until then).
- [ ] Structured logging + event-trace observability
- [ ] Auto-approve rules in `.claude/settings.local.json` for safe read-only commands

## How to use this file

- Check a box (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) the moment a task lands on `master`.
- New ideas: append under the right phase. If it's a big one, bump it to its own subsection.
- Commit TODO changes together with the code they reference, so the diff tells the story.
